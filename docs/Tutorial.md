# Tutorial: SQL_Data_Warehouse_Project

This project builds a **modern data warehouse** following a *Medallion Architecture* (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to consolidate sales data. It utilizes **ETL pipelines** to extract raw data, perform *cleansing and transformations*, and then load it into a structured **Star Schema** for easy reporting and *business intelligence*. The ultimate goal is to provide reliable data for *actionable insights* into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
